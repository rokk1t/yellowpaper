9.3 Execution Environment

\subsection{Execution Environment}\linkdest{exec_env}

In addition to the system state $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, the remaining gas for computation $g$, and the accrued substate $A$,
there are several pieces of important information used in the execution environment that the execution agent must provide; these are contained in the tuple $I$:

\begin{itemize}
\item\linkdest{address_of_account_which_owns_code_I__a_def_words}{}\linkdest{I__a} $I_{\mathrm{a}}$, the address of the account which owns the code that is executing.
\item\linkdest{address_of_sender_of_tx_that_originated_execution_I__o}{}\linkdest{I__o} $I_{\mathrm{o}}$, the sender address of the transaction that originated this execution.
\item\linkdest{gas_price_in_tx_that_originated_execution_I__p}{}\linkdest{I__p} $I_{\mathrm{p}}$, the price of gas paid by the signer of the transaction that originated this execution. This is defined as the effective gas price \hyperlink{effective_gas_price_p}{$p$} in section \ref{ch:transactions}.
\item\linkdest{execution_input_data_I__d}{}\linkdest{I__d} $I_{\mathbf{d}}$, the byte array that is the input data to this execution; if the execution agent is a transaction, this would be the transaction data.
\item\linkdest{the_address_of_the_account_which_caused_the_code_to_be_executing_I__s}{} $I_{\mathrm{s}}$, the address of the account which caused the code to be executing; if the execution agent is a transaction, this would be the transaction sender.
\item\linkdest{Wei_value_exec_I__v}{}\linkdest{I__v}{} $I_{\mathrm{v}}$, the value, in Wei, passed to this account as part of the same procedure as execution; if the execution agent is a transaction, this would be the transaction value.
\item\linkdest{exec_machine_code_I__b}{}\linkdest{I__b} $I_{\mathbf{b}}$, the byte array that is the machine code to be executed.
\item\linkdest{exec_block_header_I__H}{}\linkdest{I__H} $I_{\mathrm{H}}$, the block header of the present block.
\item\linkdest{exec_call_or_create_depth_I__e}{}\linkdest{I__e} $I_{\mathrm{e}}$, the depth of the present message-call or contract-creation (i.e. the number of {\small CALL}s or {\small CREATE(2)}s being executed at present).
\item\linkdest{exec_permission_to_modify_state_I__w}{}\linkdest{I__w} $I_{\mathrm{w}}$, the permission to make modifications to the state.
\end{itemize}

The execution model defines the function $\Xi$, which can compute the resultant state $\boldsymbol{\sigma}'$, the remaining gas $g'$, the resultant accrued substate $A'$ and the resultant output, $\mathbf{o}$, given these definitions.
For the present context, we will define it as:
\begin{equation}
(\boldsymbol{\sigma}', g', A', \mathbf{o}) \equiv \Xi(\boldsymbol{\sigma}, g, A, I)
\end{equation}
where we will remember that $A$, the accrued substate, is defined in section \ref{ch:substate}.
